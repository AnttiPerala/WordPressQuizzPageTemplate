# WordPressQuizzPageTemplate
Create Quizzes And store answers in a database

To use this, you need a Wordpress installation.
In Wordpress, make a page called quiz and set it to be the "home page" of your site in Reading Settings of WordPress.
Edit the questions and their answers in the page-quiz.php file.
The answers are stored in the WP_options table in your WordPress database.
Logged in admins can see the quizz results rendered at the bottom of the quiz page.
